-----

A. Create a small web app with a deck of 52 playing cards in React.
    1. The deck should be printable in a human-readable format.  For example: A♠    A♥    A♦    A♣    2♠  ... Q♣    K♠    K♥    K♦    K♣
    2. The deck should be shuffleable.
    3. There should be a way to deal cards out of the deck to a set number of players.  For example, deal 7 cards each to 5 players.

B. Create a small web app to consume the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) in React.
    1. The application should allow the user to search people by partial name (e.g. search for "skywalker") using SWAPI's people API endpoint.
    2. List the results in alphabetical order in a bulleted list or table.


Looking forward to seeing the results.
